# W3CSS

Summary of the W3.CSS course from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp).

It is a summary of all then content of the course on a single markdown archive, for personal use when I need check some W3CSS classes.

This file was generated with my favourite markdown editor: Typora.

Table of content (TOC) may does not work with some other markdown editors/viewers. In case some kinda error, opening it with Typora should works perfectly, and then you can generate a PDF or whatever you want to do with the content.

I hope this can help you studying W3CSS or that it will be as useful as me to consult quick questions about it. Cheers <3
